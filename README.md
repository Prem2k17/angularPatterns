## Purpose

If you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring Angular applications, then step right in.

The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building Angular applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.

## What is not Angularjs

###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

  1. It's not a JavaScript library. Because, there is no functions which we can directly call and use
  1. It's not a DOM manipulation library like jQuery 

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## What AngularJS is

###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

   1. AngularJS is a Javascript MVC Framework created by Google to build properly architectured and maintenable web applications.
   1. Focus more on HTML side of web apps.

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Features of AngularJS

###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

   1.  Enhances HTML by attaching directives, custom tags, attributes, expressions, templates within HTML.
   1.  Good for Single Page Applications (SPA).
   1.  Easy Data Binding, Two way data Binding.
   1.  Reusable components.
   1.  Dependency Injection.
   1.  E2E Testing, Unit testing is easier.

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Where we can use AngularJS

###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

   1. Single Page Applications (SPA)
   1. Dynamic web applications
   1. RESTful applications
   1. CRUD based applications
   1. Mobile applications

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Development support tools for AngularJS

###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]
   1. Eclipse or VSC (Visual studio code) [Code Editor]
   1. Google Chrome browser (Recommended)
   1. NodeJS (For client server) [Optional]
   1. GitHub (For accessing external repositories) [Optional]
   1. NPM, Bower (For managing external resources/plugins) [Optional]
   1. Gulp (Task runner) [Optional]


**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## What is Gulp

###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

   1. Gulp is a task runner. It is the commander of our army of helper robots that take critical, yet totally mundane, tasks and perform them hundreds of times per day so we don't have to. When we sit down to work, we want to enter a single command, and then spend the rest of our day writing code testing, and basically not thinking about how it is all glued together in the background.

   1. Automation is critical to any project of significant size. We will start with the Eggly Bookmarks application, and develop proper build automation that will include production ready tools that you can start using in your applications today!


Here are the top features of the setup:

   1. Development and production environments
   1. A development server that can serve either environment
   1. Watch tasks for both environments
   1. Live-reload capability—web page is auto-refreshed on change
   1. Uses Foundation/SASS
   1. Partials pre-loaded into the angular template cache
   1. Full hinting/concatenation/uglification/sourcemaps for all prod files
   1. Dev server automatically refreshed when source changes

## How Angular app works

###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

![Sample App Structure](https://github.com/Prem2k17/angularPatterns/blob/master/images/AngularFlow.PNG)


**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Single Responsibility

###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

  - Define 1 component per file.

  *Why?*: One component per file promotes easier unit testing.

  *Why?*: One component per file makes it far easier to read, maintain, and avoid collisions with teams in source control.

  *Why?*: One component per file avoids hidden bugs that often arise when combining components in a file where they may share variables, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.

  The following example defines the `app` module and its dependencies, defines a controller, and defines a factory all in the same file.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  angular
      .module('app', ['ngRoute'])
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController)
      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);

  function SomeController() { }

  function someFactory() { }
  ```

  The same components are now separated into their own files.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // app.module.js
  angular
      .module('app', ['ngRoute']);
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // some.controller.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  function SomeController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // some.factory.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);

  function someFactory() { }
  ```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## IIFE
### JavaScript Scopes
###### [Style [Y010](#style-y010)]

  - Wrap Angular components in an 'Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)'.

  *Why?*: An IIFE removes variables from the global scope. This helps prevent variables and function declarations from living longer than expected in the global scope, which also helps avoid variable collisions.

  *Why?*: When your code is minified and bundled into a single file for deployment to a production server, you could have collisions of variables and many global variables. An IIFE protects you against both of these by providing variable scope for each file.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  // logger.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('logger', logger);

  // logger function is added as a global variable
  function logger() { }

  // storage.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('storage', storage);

  // storage function is added as a global variable
  function storage() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /**
   * recommended
   *
   * no globals are left behind
   */

  // logger.js
  (function() {
      'use strict';

      angular
          .module('app')
          .factory('logger', logger);

      function logger() { }
  })();

  // storage.js
  (function() {
      'use strict';

      angular
          .module('app')
          .factory('storage', storage);

      function storage() { }
  })();
  ```

  - Note: For brevity only, the rest of the examples in this guide may omit the IIFE syntax.

  - Note: IIFE's prevent test code from reaching private members like regular expressions or helper functions which are often good to unit test directly on their own. However you can test these through accessible members or by exposing them through their own component. For example placing helper functions, regular expressions or constants in their own factory or constant.

### Dependency Injection

###### [Style [Y020](#style-y020)]

   1. The process of injecting dependent functionality into modules at run time

   Two types of injection is accepted in angular modules:

   1 - Using 'Constructor Function'
![Constructor Function](https://github.com/Prem2k17/angularPatterns/blob/master/images/constructorInjection.png)
   2 - Using 'Injectable Factory Method'.

![Injectable Factory](https://github.com/Prem2k17/angularPatterns/blob/master/images/factoryInjection.PNG)


**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Modules

### Avoid Naming Collisions
###### [Style [Y020](#style-y020)]

  - Use unique naming conventions with separators for sub-modules.

  *Why?*: Unique names help avoid module name collisions. Separators help define modules and their submodule hierarchy. For example `app` may be your root module while `app.dashboard` and `app.users` may be modules that are used as dependencies of `app`.

### Definitions (aka Setters)
###### [Style [Y021](#style-y021)]

  - Declare modules without a variable using the setter syntax.

  *Why?*: With 1 component per file, there is rarely a need to introduce a variable for the module.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  var app = angular.module('app', [
      'ngAnimate',
      'ngRoute',
      'app.shared',
      'app.dashboard'
  ]);
  ```

  Instead use the simple setter syntax.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  angular
      .module('app', [
          'ngAnimate',
          'ngRoute',
          'app.shared',
          'app.dashboard'
      ]);
  ```

### Getters
###### [Style [Y022](#style-y022)]

  - When using a module, avoid using a variable and instead use chaining with the getter syntax.

  *Why?*: This produces more readable code and avoids variable collisions or leaks.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  var app = angular.module('app');
  app.controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  function SomeController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  function SomeController() { }
  ```

### Setting vs Getting
###### [Style [Y023](#style-y023)]

  - Only set once and get for all other instances.

  *Why?*: A module should only be created once, then retrieved from that point and after.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // to set a module
  angular.module('app', []);

  // to get a module
  angular.module('app');
  ```

### Named vs Anonymous Functions
###### [Style [Y024](#style-y024)]

  - Use named functions instead of passing an anonymous function in as a callback.

  *Why?*: This produces more readable code, is much easier to debug, and reduces the amount of nested callback code.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('DashboardController', function() { })
      .factory('logger', function() { });
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // dashboard.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('DashboardController', DashboardController);

  function DashboardController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  // logger.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('logger', logger);

  function logger() { }
  ```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Controllers

### controllerAs View Syntax
###### [Style [Y030](#style-y030)]

  - Use the "controllerAs" syntax over the `classic controller with $scope` syntax.

  *Why?*: Controllers are constructed, "newed" up, and provide a single new instance, and the `controllerAs` syntax is closer to that of a JavaScript constructor than the `classic $scope syntax`.

  *Why?*: It promotes the use of binding to a "dotted" object in the View (e.g. `customer.name` instead of `name`), which is more contextual, easier to read, and avoids any reference issues that may occur without "dotting".

  *Why?*: Helps avoid using `$parent` calls in Views with nested controllers.

  ```html
  <!-- avoid -->
  <div ng-controller="CustomerController">
      {{ name }}
  </div>
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- recommended -->
  <div ng-controller="CustomerController as customer">
      {{ customer.name }}
  </div>
  ```

### controllerAs Controller Syntax
###### [Style [Y031](#style-y031)]

  - Use the `controllerAs` syntax over the `classic controller with $scope` syntax.

  - The `controllerAs` syntax uses `this` inside controllers which gets bound to `$scope`

  *Why?*: `controllerAs` is syntactic sugar over `$scope`. You can still bind to the View and still access `$scope` methods.

  *Why?*: Helps avoid the temptation of using `$scope` methods inside a controller when it may otherwise be better to avoid them or move the method to a factory, and reference them from the controller. Consider using `$scope` in a controller only when needed. For example when publishing and subscribing events using [`$emit`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$emit), [`$broadcast`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$broadcast), or [`$on`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$on).

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function CustomerController($scope) {
      $scope.name = {};
      $scope.sendMessage = function() { };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended - but see next section */
  function CustomerController() {
      this.name = {};
      this.sendMessage = function() { };
  }
  ```

### controllerAs with vm
###### [Style [Y032](#style-y032)]

  - Use a capture variable for `this` when using the `controllerAs` syntax. Choose a consistent variable name such as `vm`, which stands for ViewModel.

  *Why?*: The `this` keyword is contextual and when used within a function inside a controller may change its context. Capturing the context of `this` avoids encountering this problem.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function CustomerController() {
      this.name = {};
      this.sendMessage = function() { };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function CustomerController() {
      var vm = this;
      vm.name = {};
      vm.sendMessage = function() { };
  }
  ```

  Example :

  ```html
  <input ng-model="vm.title"/>
  ```

  ```javascript
  function SomeController($scope) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.title = 'Some Title';
  }
  ```

  Note: When working with larger codebases, using a more descriptive name can help ease cognitive overhead & searchability.

  ```html
  <!-- avoid -->
  <input ng-model="customerProductItemVm.title">
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- recommended -->
  <input ng-model="productVm.title">
  ```

### Bindable Members Up Top
###### [Style [Y033](#style-y033)]

  - Place bindable members at the top of the controller, alphabetized, and not spread through the controller code.

    *Why?*: Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller can be bound and used in the View.

    *Why?*: Setting anonymous functions in-line can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability. Defining the functions below the bindable members (the functions will be hoisted) moves the implementation details down, keeps the bindable members up top, and makes it easier to read.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function SessionsController() {
      var vm = this;

      vm.gotoSession = function() {
        /* ... */
      };
      vm.refresh = function() {
        /* ... */
      };
      vm.search = function() {
        /* ... */
      };
      vm.sessions = [];
      vm.title = 'Sessions';
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function SessionsController() {
      var vm = this;

      vm.gotoSession = gotoSession;
      vm.refresh = refresh;
      vm.search = search;
      vm.sessions = [];
      vm.title = 'Sessions';

      ////////////

      function gotoSession() {
        /* */
      }

      function refresh() {
        /* */
      }

      function search() {
        /* */
      }
  }
  ```

### Keep Controllers Focused
###### [Style [Y037](#style-y037)]

  - Define a controller for a view, and try not to reuse the controller for other views. Instead, move reusable logic to factories and keep the controller simple and focused on its view.

    *Why?*: Reusing controllers with several views is brittle and good end-to-end (e2e) test coverage is required to ensure stability across large applications.

### Assigning Controllers
###### [Style [Y038](#style-y038)]

  - When a controller must be paired with a view and either component may be re-used by other controllers or views, define controllers along with their routes.

    Note: If a View is loaded via another means besides a route, then use the `ng-controller="Avengers as vm"` syntax.

    *Why?*: Pairing the controller in the route allows different routes to invoke different pairs of controllers and views. When controllers are assigned in the view using [`ng-controller`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngController), that view is always associated with the same controller.

 ```javascript
  /* avoid - when using with a route and dynamic pairing is desired */

  // route-config.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .config(config);

  function config($routeProvider) {
      $routeProvider
          .when('/avengers', {
            templateUrl: 'avengers.html'
          });
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- avengers.html -->
  <div ng-controller="AvengersController as vm">
  </div>
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // route-config.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .config(config);

  function config($routeProvider) {
      $routeProvider
          .when('/avengers', {
              templateUrl: 'avengers.html',
              controller: 'Avengers',
              controllerAs: 'vm'
          });
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- avengers.html -->
  <div>
  </div>
  ```

## Services

### Singletons
###### [Style [Y040](#style-y040)]

  - Services are instantiated with the `new` keyword, use `this` for public methods and variables. Since these are so similar to factories, use a factory instead for consistency.

    Note: [All Angular services are singletons](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services). This means that there is only one instance of a given service per injector.

  ```javascript
  // service
  angular
      .module('app')
      .service('logger', logger);

  function logger() {
    this.logError = function(msg) {
      /* */
    };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  // factory
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('logger', logger);

  function logger() {
      return {
          logError: function(msg) {
            /* */
          }
     };
  }
  ```

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Factories

### Single Responsibility
###### [Style [Y050](#style-y050)]

  - Factories should have a [single responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), that is encapsulated by its context. Once a factory begins to exceed that singular purpose, a new factory should be created.

### Singletons
###### [Style [Y051](#style-y051)]

  - Factories are singletons and return an object that contains the members of the service.

    Note: [All Angular services are singletons](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services).

### Accessible Members Up Top
###### [Style [Y052](#style-y052)]

  - Expose the callable members of the service (its interface) at the top, using a technique derived from the [Revealing Module Pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript).

    *Why?*: Placing the callable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the service can be called and must be unit tested (and/or mocked).

    *Why?*: This is especially helpful when the file gets longer as it helps avoid the need to scroll to see what is exposed.

    *Why?*: Setting functions as you go can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability and cause more scrolling. Defining the callable interface via the returned service moves the implementation details down, keeps the callable interface up top, and makes it easier to read.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function dataService() {
    var someValue = '';
    function save() {
      /* */
    };
    function validate() {
      /* */
    };

    return {
        save: save,
        someValue: someValue,
        validate: validate
    };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function dataService() {
      var someValue = '';
      var service = {
          save: save,
          someValue: someValue,
          validate: validate
      };
      return service;

      ////////////

      function save() {
          /* */
      };

      function validate() {
          /* */
      };
  }
  ```

### Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details
###### [Style [Y053](#style-y053)]

  - Use function declarations to hide implementation details. Keep your accessible members of the factory up top. Point those to function declarations that appears later in the file.

    *Why?*: Placing accessible members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which functions of the factory you can access externally.

    *Why?*: Placing the implementation details of a function later in the file moves that complexity out of view so you can see the important stuff up top.

    *Why?*: Function declarations are hoisted so there are no concerns over using a function before it is defined (as there would be with function expressions).

    *Why?*: You never have to worry with function declarations that moving `var a` before `var b` will break your code because `a` depends on `b`.

    *Why?*: Order is critical with function expressions

  ```javascript
  /**
   * avoid
   * Using function expressions
   */
   function dataservice($http, $location, $q, exception, logger) {
      var isPrimed = false;
      var primePromise;

      var getAvengers = function() {
          // implementation details go here
      };

      var getAvengerCount = function() {
          // implementation details go here
      };

      var getAvengersCast = function() {
         // implementation details go here
      };

      var prime = function() {
         // implementation details go here
      };

      var ready = function(nextPromises) {
          // implementation details go here
      };

      var service = {
          getAvengersCast: getAvengersCast,
          getAvengerCount: getAvengerCount,
          getAvengers: getAvengers,
          ready: ready
      };

      return service;
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /**
   * recommended
   * Using function declarations
   * and accessible members up top.
   */
  function dataservice($http, $location, $q, exception, logger) {
      var isPrimed = false;
      var primePromise;

      var service = {
          getAvengersCast: getAvengersCast,
          getAvengerCount: getAvengerCount,
          getAvengers: getAvengers,
          ready: ready
      };

      return service;

      ////////////

      function getAvengers() {
          // implementation details go here
      }

      function getAvengerCount() {
          // implementation details go here
      }

      function getAvengersCast() {
          // implementation details go here
      }

      function prime() {
          // implementation details go here
      }

      function ready(nextPromises) {
          // implementation details go here
      }
  }
  ```

## Data Services

### Separate Data Calls
###### [Style [Y060](#style-y060)]

  - Refactor logic for making data operations and interacting with data to a factory. Make data services responsible for XHR calls, local storage, stashing in memory, or any other data operations.

    *Why?*: The controller's responsibility is for the presentation and gathering of information for the view. It should not care how it gets the data, just that it knows who to ask for it. Separating the data services moves the logic on how to get it to the data service, and lets the controller be simpler and more focused on the view.

    *Why?*: This makes it easier to test (mock or real) the data calls when testing a controller that uses a data service.

    *Why?*: Data service implementation may have very specific code to handle the data repository. This may include headers, how to talk to the data, or other services such as `$http`. Separating the logic into a data service encapsulates this logic in a single place hiding the implementation from the outside consumers (perhaps a controller), also making it easier to change the implementation.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // dataservice factory
  angular
      .module('app.core')
      .factory('dataservice', dataservice);

  dataservice.$inject = ['$http', 'logger'];

  function dataservice($http, logger) {
      return {
          getAvengers: getAvengers
      };

      function getAvengers() {
          return $http.get('/api/maa')
              .then(getAvengersComplete)
              .catch(getAvengersFailed);

          function getAvengersComplete(response) {
              return response.data.results;
          }

          function getAvengersFailed(error) {
              logger.error('XHR Failed for getAvengers.' + error.data);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

    Note: The data service is called from consumers, such as a controller, hiding the implementation from the consumers, as shown below.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // controller calling the dataservice factory
  angular
      .module('app.avengers')
      .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController);

  AvengersController.$inject = ['dataservice', 'logger'];

  function AvengersController(dataservice, logger) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.avengers = [];

      activate();

      function activate() {
          return getAvengers().then(function() {
              logger.info('Activated Avengers View');
          });
      }

      function getAvengers() {
          return dataservice.getAvengers()
              .then(function(data) {
                  vm.avengers = data;
                  return vm.avengers;
              });
      }
  }
  ```

### Return a Promise from Data Calls
###### [Style [Y061](#style-y061)]

  - When calling a data service that returns a promise such as `$http`, return a promise in your calling function too.

    *Why?*: You can chain the promises together and take further action after the data call completes and resolves or rejects the promise.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  activate();

  function activate() {
      /**
       * Step 1
       * Ask the getAvengers function for the
       * avenger data and wait for the promise
       */
      return getAvengers().then(function() {
          /**
           * Step 4
           * Perform an action on resolve of final promise
           */
          logger.info('Activated Avengers View');
      });
  }

  function getAvengers() {
        /**
         * Step 2
         * Ask the data service for the data and wait
         * for the promise
         */
        return dataservice.getAvengers()
            .then(function(data) {
                /**
                 * Step 3
                 * set the data and resolve the promise
                 */
                vm.avengers = data;
                return vm.avengers;
        });
  }
  ```

## Services Vs Factories

###### [Style [Y070](#style-y070)]

![Sample App Structure](https://github.com/Prem2k17/angularPatterns/blob/master/images/servicesFactoies.PNG)

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Directives
### Limit 1 Per File
###### [Style [Y070](#style-y070)]

  - Create one directive per file. Name the file for the directive.

    *Why?*: It is easy to mash all the directives in one file, but difficult to then break those out so some are shared across apps, some across modules, some just for one module.

    *Why?*: One directive per file is easy to maintain.

    > Note: "**Best Practice**: Directives should clean up after themselves. You can use `element.on('$destroy', ...)` or `scope.$on('$destroy', ...)` to run a clean-up function when the directive is removed" ... from the Angular documentation.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  /* directives.js */

  angular
      .module('app.widgets')

      /* order directive that is specific to the order module */
      .directive('orderCalendarRange', orderCalendarRange)

      /* sales directive that can be used anywhere across the sales app */
      .directive('salesCustomerInfo', salesCustomerInfo)

      /* spinner directive that can be used anywhere across apps */
      .directive('sharedSpinner', sharedSpinner);

  function orderCalendarRange() {
      /* implementation details */
  }

  function salesCustomerInfo() {
      /* implementation details */
  }

  function sharedSpinner() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* calendar-range.directive.js */

  /**
   * @desc order directive that is specific to the order module at a company named Acme
   * @example <div acme-order-calendar-range></div>
   */
  angular
      .module('sales.order')
      .directive('acmeOrderCalendarRange', orderCalendarRange);

  function orderCalendarRange() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* customer-info.directive.js */

  /**
   * @desc sales directive that can be used anywhere across the sales app at a company named Acme
   * @example <div acme-sales-customer-info></div>
   */
  angular
      .module('sales.widgets')
      .directive('acmeSalesCustomerInfo', salesCustomerInfo);

  function salesCustomerInfo() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  /* spinner.directive.js */

  /**
   * @desc spinner directive that can be used anywhere across apps at a company named Acme
   * @example <div acme-shared-spinner></div>
   */
  angular
      .module('shared.widgets')
      .directive('acmeSharedSpinner', sharedSpinner);

  function sharedSpinner() {
      /* implementation details */
  }
  ```

    Note: There are many naming options for directives, especially since they can be used in narrow or wide scopes. Choose one that makes the directive and its file name distinct and clear. Some examples are below, but see the [Naming](#naming) section for more recommendations.

## Filters
###### [Style [Y070](#style-y070)]

   1. Filters format the value of an expression for display to the user
   1. They can be used in view templates, controllers or services.

## Resolving Promises
### Controller Activation Promises
###### [Style [Y080](#style-y080)]

  - Resolve start-up logic for a controller in an `activate` function.

    *Why?*: Placing start-up logic in a consistent place in the controller makes it easier to locate, more consistent to test, and helps avoid spreading out the activation logic across the controller.

    *Why?*: The controller `activate` makes it convenient to re-use the logic for a refresh for the controller/View, keeps the logic together, gets the user to the View faster, makes animations easy on the `ng-view` or `ui-view`, and feels snappier to the user.

    Note: If you need to conditionally cancel the route before you start using the controller, use a [route resolve](#style-y081) instead.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function AvengersController(dataservice) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.avengers = [];
      vm.title = 'Avengers';

      dataservice.getAvengers().then(function(data) {
          vm.avengers = data;
          return vm.avengers;
      });
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function AvengersController(dataservice) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.avengers = [];
      vm.title = 'Avengers';

      activate();

      ////////////

      function activate() {
          return dataservice.getAvengers().then(function(data) {
              vm.avengers = data;
              return vm.avengers;
          });
      }
  }
  ```

### Route Resolve Promises
###### [Style [Y081](#style-y081)]

  - When a controller depends on a promise to be resolved before the controller is activated, resolve those dependencies in the `$routeProvider` before the controller logic is executed. If you need to conditionally cancel a route before the controller is activated, use a route resolver.

  - Use a route resolve when you want to decide to cancel the route before ever transitioning to the View.

    *Why?*: A controller may require data before it loads. That data may come from a promise via a custom factory or [$http](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http). Using a [route resolve](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute/provider/$routeProvider) allows the promise to resolve before the controller logic executes, so it might take action based on that data from the promise.

    *Why?*: The code executes after the route and in the controller’s activate function. The View starts to load right away. Data binding kicks in when the activate promise resolves. A “busy” animation can be shown during the view transition (via `ng-view` or `ui-view`)

    Note: The code executes before the route via a promise. Rejecting the promise cancels the route. Resolve makes the new view wait for the route to resolve. A “busy” animation can be shown before the resolve and through the view transition. If you want to get to the View faster and do not require a checkpoint to decide if you can get to the View, consider the [controller `activate` technique](#style-y080) instead.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController);

  function AvengersController(movieService) {
      var vm = this;
      // unresolved
      vm.movies;
      // resolved asynchronously
      movieService.getMovies().then(function(response) {
          vm.movies = response.movies;
      });
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* better */

  // route-config.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .config(config);

  function config($routeProvider) {
      $routeProvider
          .when('/avengers', {
              templateUrl: 'avengers.html',
              controller: 'AvengersController',
              controllerAs: 'vm',
              resolve: {
                  moviesPrepService: function(movieService) {
                      return movieService.getMovies();
                  }
              }
          });
  }

  // avengers.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController);

  AvengersController.$inject = ['moviesPrepService'];
  function AvengersController(moviesPrepService) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.movies = moviesPrepService.movies;
  }
  ```

    Note: The example below shows the route resolve points to a named function, which is easier to debug and easier to handle dependency injection.

  ```javascript
  /* even better */

  // route-config.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .config(config);

  function config($routeProvider) {
      $routeProvider
          .when('/avengers', {
              templateUrl: 'avengers.html',
              controller: 'AvengersController',
              controllerAs: 'vm',
              resolve: {
                  moviesPrepService: moviesPrepService
              }
          });
  }

  function moviesPrepService(movieService) {
      return movieService.getMovies();
  }

  // avengers.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('AvengersController', AvengersController);

  AvengersController.$inject = ['moviesPrepService'];
  function AvengersController(moviesPrepService) {
        var vm = this;
        vm.movies = moviesPrepService.movies;
  }
  ```
    Note: The code example's dependency on `movieService` is not minification safe on its own. For details on how to make this code minification safe, see the sections on [dependency injection](#manual-annotating-for-dependency-injection) and on [minification and annotation](#minification-and-annotation).

## Exception Handling

### decorators
###### [Style [Y110](#style-y110)]

  - Use a [decorator](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/auto/service/$provide#decorator), at config time using the [`$provide`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/auto/service/$provide) service, on the [`$exceptionHandler`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$exceptionHandler) service to perform custom actions when exceptions occur.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to handle uncaught Angular exceptions for development-time or run-time.

    Note: Another option is to override the service instead of using a decorator. This is a fine option, but if you want to keep the default behavior and extend it a decorator is recommended.

    ```javascript
    /* recommended */
    angular
        .module('blocks.exception')
        .config(exceptionConfig);

    exceptionConfig.$inject = ['$provide'];

    function exceptionConfig($provide) {
        $provide.decorator('$exceptionHandler', extendExceptionHandler);
    }

    extendExceptionHandler.$inject = ['$delegate', 'toastr'];

    function extendExceptionHandler($delegate, toastr) {
        return function(exception, cause) {
            $delegate(exception, cause);
            var errorData = {
                exception: exception,
                cause: cause
            };
            /**
             * Could add the error to a service's collection,
             * add errors to $rootScope, log errors to remote web server,
             * or log locally. Or throw hard. It is entirely up to you.
             * throw exception;
             */
            toastr.error(exception.msg, errorData);
        };
    }
    ```

## Naming

### Naming Guidelines
###### [Style [Y120](#style-y120)]

  - Use consistent names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then (optionally) its type. My recommended pattern is `feature.type.js`. There are 2 names for most assets:
    * the file name (`avengers.controller.js`)
    * the registered component name with Angular (`AvengersController`)

    *Why?*: Naming conventions help provide a consistent way to find content at a glance. Consistency within the project is vital. Consistency with a team is important. Consistency across a company provides tremendous efficiency.

    *Why?*: The naming conventions should simply help you find your code faster and make it easier to understand.

### Feature File Names
###### [Style [Y121](#style-y121)]

  - Use consistent names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then (optionally) its type. My recommended pattern is `feature.type.js`.

    *Why?*: Provides a consistent way to quickly identify components.

    *Why?*: Provides pattern matching for any automated tasks.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * common options
     */

    // Controllers
    avengers.js
    avengers.controller.js
    avengersController.js

    // Services/Factories
    logger.js
    logger.service.js
    loggerService.js
    ```

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    // controllers
    avengers.controller.js
    avengers.controller.spec.js

    // services/factories
    logger.service.js
    logger.service.spec.js

    // constants
    constants.js

    // module definition
    avengers.module.js

    // routes
    avengers.routes.js
    avengers.routes.spec.js

    // configuration
    avengers.config.js

    // directives
    avenger-profile.directive.js
    avenger-profile.directive.spec.js
    ```

  Note: Another common convention is naming controller files without the word `controller` in the file name such as `avengers.js` instead of `avengers.controller.js`. All other conventions still hold using a suffix of the type. Controllers are the most common type of component so this just saves typing and is still easily identifiable. I recommend you choose 1 convention and be consistent for your team. My preference is `avengers.controller.js` identifying the `AvengersController`.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */
    // Controllers
    avengers.js
    avengers.spec.js
    ```


### Modules
###### [Style [Y127](#style-y127)]

  - When there are multiple modules, the main module file is named `app.module.js` while other dependent modules are named after what they represent. For example, an admin module is named `admin.module.js`. The respective registered module names would be `app` and `admin`.

    *Why?*: Provides consistency for multiple module apps, and for expanding to large applications.

    *Why?*: Provides easy way to use task automation to load all module definitions first, then all other angular files (for bundling).

### Configuration
###### [Style [Y128](#style-y128)]

  - Separate configuration for a module into its own file named after the module. A configuration file for the main `app` module is named `app.config.js` (or simply `config.js`). A configuration for a module named `admin.module.js` is named `admin.config.js`.

    *Why?*: Separates configuration from module definition, components, and active code.

    *Why?*: Provides an identifiable place to set configuration for a module.

### Routes
###### [Style [Y129](#style-y129)]

  - Separate route configuration into its own file. Examples might be `app.route.js` for the main module and `admin.route.js` for the `admin` module. Even in smaller apps I prefer this separation from the rest of the configuration.

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Application Structure LIFT Principle
### LIFT
###### [Style [Y140](#style-y140)]

  - Structure your app such that you can `L`ocate your code quickly, `I`dentify the code at a glance, keep the `F`lattest structure you can, and `T`ry to stay DRY. The structure should follow these 4 basic guidelines.

    *Why LIFT?*: Provides a consistent structure that scales well, is modular, and makes it easier to increase developer efficiency by finding code quickly. Another way to check your app structure is to ask yourself: How quickly can you open and work in all of the related files for a feature?

    When I find my structure is not feeling comfortable, I go back and revisit these LIFT guidelines

    1. `L`ocating our code is easy
    2. `I`dentify code at a glance
    3. `F`lat structure as long as we can
    4. `T`ry to stay DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) or T-DRY

### Locate
###### [Style [Y141](#style-y141)]

  - Make locating your code intuitive, simple and fast.

    *Why?*: I find this to be super important for a project. If the team cannot find the files they need to work on quickly, they will not be able to work as efficiently as possible, and the structure needs to change. You may not know the file name or where its related files are, so putting them in the most intuitive locations and near each other saves a ton of time. A descriptive folder structure can help with this.

    ```
    /bower_components
    /client
      /app
        /avengers
        /blocks
          /exception
          /logger
        /core
        /dashboard
        /data
        /layout
        /widgets
      /content
      index.html
    .bower.json
    ```

### Identify
###### [Style [Y142](#style-y142)]

  - When you look at a file you should instantly know what it contains and represents.

    *Why?*: You spend less time hunting and pecking for code, and become more efficient. If this means you want longer file names, then so be it. Be descriptive with file names and keeping the contents of the file to exactly 1 component. Avoid files with multiple controllers, multiple services, or a mixture. There are deviations of the 1 per file rule when I have a set of very small features that are all related to each other, they are still easily identifiable.

### Flat
###### [Style [Y143](#style-y143)]

  - Keep a flat folder structure as long as possible. When you get to 7+ files, begin considering separation.

    *Why?*: Nobody wants to search 7 levels of folders to find a file. Think about menus on web sites … anything deeper than 2 should take serious consideration. In a folder structure there is no hard and fast number rule, but when a folder has 7-10 files, that may be time to create subfolders. Base it on your comfort level. Use a flatter structure until there is an obvious value (to help the rest of LIFT) in creating a new folder.

### T-DRY (Try to Stick to DRY)
###### [Style [Y144](#style-y144)]

  - Be DRY, but don't go nuts and sacrifice readability.

    *Why?*: Being DRY is important, but not crucial if it sacrifices the others in LIFT, which is why I call it T-DRY. I don’t want to type session-view.html for a view because, well, it’s obviously a view. If it is not obvious or by convention, then I name it.

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Application Structure

### Layout
###### [Style [Y151](#style-y151)]

  - Place components that define the overall layout of the application in a folder named `layout`. These may include a shell view and controller may act as the container for the app, navigation, menus, content areas, and other regions.

    *Why?*: Organizes all layout in a single place re-used throughout the application.

### Folders-by-Feature Structure
###### [Style [Y152](#style-y152)]

  - Create folders named for the feature they represent. When a folder grows to contain more than 7 files, start to consider creating a folder for them. Your threshold may be different, so adjust as needed.

    *Why?*: A developer can locate the code, identify what each file represents at a glance, the structure is flat as can be, and there is no repetitive nor redundant names.

    *Why?*: The LIFT guidelines are all covered.

    *Why?*: Helps reduce the app from becoming cluttered through organizing the content and keeping them aligned with the LIFT guidelines.

    *Why?*: When there are a lot of files (10+) locating them is easier with a consistent folder structures and more difficult in flat structures.

    ```javascript
    /**
     * recommended
     */

    app/
        app.module.js
        app.config.js
        components/
            calendar.directive.js
            calendar.directive.html
            user-profile.directive.js
            user-profile.directive.html
        layout/
            shell.html
            shell.controller.js
            topnav.html
            topnav.controller.js
        people/
            attendees.html
            attendees.controller.js
            people.routes.js
            speakers.html
            speakers.controller.js
            speaker-detail.html
            speaker-detail.controller.js
        services/
            data.service.js
            localstorage.service.js
            logger.service.js
            spinner.service.js
        sessions/
            sessions.html
            sessions.controller.js
            sessions.routes.js
            session-detail.html
            session-detail.controller.js
    ```

      Note: Do not structure your app using folders-by-type. This requires moving to multiple folders when working on a feature and gets unwieldy quickly as the app grows to 5, 10 or 25+ views and controllers (and other features), which makes it more difficult than folder-by-feature to locate files.

    ```javascript
    /*
    * avoid
    * Alternative folders-by-type.
    * I recommend "folders-by-feature", instead.
    */

        directives.js

            attendees.js

## JS Hint

### Use an Options File
###### [Style [Y230](#style-y230)]

  - Use JS Hint for linting your JavaScript and be sure to customize the JS Hint options file and include in source control. See the [JS Hint docs](http://jshint.com/docs/) for details on the options.

    *Why?*: Provides a first alert prior to committing any code to source control.

    *Why?*: Provides consistency across your team.

## Values

###### [Style [Y240](#style-y240)]

  - Create an Angular value for app global variables.

    *Why?*: Provides a way to inject globals. 
    This improves code testability by allowing you to more easily know what the dependencies of your components are (avoids leaky abstractions). 
    It also allows you to mock these dependencies, where it makes sense.

    ```javascript
    // constants.js

    /* creating application level default value for company Id as 2 */
    (function() {
        'use strict';

        angular
            .module('app.core')
            .value('company Id', '2');            
    })();
    ```

## Constants

###### [Style [Y240](#style-y240)]

  - Create an Angular Constant for vendor libraries' global variables.

    *Why?*: Provides a way to inject vendor libraries that otherwise are globals. This improves code testability by allowing you to more easily know what the dependencies of your components are (avoids leaky abstractions). It also allows you to mock these dependencies, where it makes sense.

    ```javascript
    // constants.js

    /* creating application level constant value for company Id as 2 */
    (function() {
        'use strict';

        angular
            .module('app.core')            
            .constant('company Id', '2');
    })();
    ```

## Difference between Values and Constants

*Value*     : 'can be re-assigned' anywhere in the application after decleration.
*Constants* : 'can't be re-assigned' in the application after decleration.

###### [Style [Y241](#style-y241)]

  - Use constants for values that do not change and do not come from another service. When constants are used only for a module that may be reused in multiple applications, place constants in a file per module named after the module. Until this is required, keep constants in the main module in a `constants.js` file.

    *Why?*: A value that may change, even infrequently, should be retrieved from a service so you do not have to change the source code. For example, a url for a data service could be placed in a constants but a better place would be to load it from a web service.

    *Why?*: Constants can be injected into any angular component, including providers.

    *Why?*: When an application is separated into modules that may be reused in other applications, each stand-alone module should be able to operate on its own including any dependent constants.

    ```javascript
    // Constants used by the entire app
    angular
        .module('app.core')
        .constant('moment', moment);

    // Constants used only by the sales module
    angular
        .module('app.sales')
        .constant('events', {
            ORDER_CREATED: 'event_order_created',
            INVENTORY_DEPLETED: 'event_inventory_depleted'
        });
    ```

## Routing
Client-side routing is important for creating a navigation flow between views and composing views that are made of many smaller templates and directives.

###### [Style [Y270](#style-y270)]

  - Use the [AngularUI Router](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/) for client-side routing.

    *Why?*: UI Router offers all the features of the Angular router plus a few additional ones including nested routes and states.

    *Why?*: The syntax is quite similar to the Angular router and is easy to migrate to UI Router.

  - Note: You can use a provider such as the `routerHelperProvider` shown below to help configure states across files, during the run phase.

    ```javascript
    // customers.routes.js
    angular
        .module('app.customers')
        .run(appRun);

    /* @ngInject */
    function appRun(routerHelper) {
        routerHelper.configureStates(getStates());
    }

    function getStates() {
        return [
            {
                state: 'customer',
                config: {
                    abstract: true,
                    template: '<ui-view class="shuffle-animation"/>',
                    url: '/customer'
                }
            }
        ];
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    // routerHelperProvider.js
    angular
        .module('blocks.router')
        .provider('routerHelper', routerHelperProvider);

    routerHelperProvider.$inject = ['$locationProvider', '$stateProvider', '$urlRouterProvider'];
    /* @ngInject */
    function routerHelperProvider($locationProvider, $stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {
        /* jshint validthis:true */
        this.$get = RouterHelper;

        $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);

        RouterHelper.$inject = ['$state'];
        /* @ngInject */
        function RouterHelper($state) {
            var hasOtherwise = false;

            var service = {
                configureStates: configureStates,
                getStates: getStates
            };

            return service;

            ///////////////

            function configureStates(states, otherwisePath) {
                states.forEach(function(state) {
                    $stateProvider.state(state.state, state.config);
                });
                if (otherwisePath && !hasOtherwise) {
                    hasOtherwise = true;
                    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise(otherwisePath);
                }
            }

            function getStates() { return $state.get(); }
        }
    }
    ```

###### [Style [Y271](#style-y271)]

  - Define routes for views in the module where they exist. Each module should contain the routes for the views in the module.

    *Why?*: Each module should be able to stand on its own.

    *Why?*: When removing a module or adding a module, the app will only contain routes that point to existing views.

    *Why?*: This makes it easy to enable or disable portions of an application without concern over orphaned routes.
